Despite the courageous <script>InfoLinkG('efforts','/storage/readmeswat.html');</script> of the original S.W.A.T. team, the government resorted to nuclear detonation in a vain attempt to end the infestation of Raccoon City. Not only did the blast fail to keep the zombies down, but the intense city-wide radiation bestowed new mutant abilities unto the minions!<br><br>
Bravo team was testing new, advanced equipment in a secret bomb shelter when the explosion devastated the city. You are a member of this team, and your squad now has the daunting task of eliminating this threat once and for all. But saving the city requires more than shooting undead.<br><br>
A scientist in a secret lab under the original S.W.A.T. Headquarters is working on an antidote for the virus using the components recovered by Alpha team. You must prove its effectiveness by curing and evacuating civilians. You must also prepare the city for external aid by restoring power and reducing radiation. Successful completion of these objectives will save the city and possibly the nation!

<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>S</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>tay together.</font>
Any hero can kill incoming zombies, but if you're alone when a large pack comes at you, you're in trouble. Staying with the team allows everyone's skills to benefit each other and provides a wall of fire to keep the undead at bay.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>K</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>eep away from enemies.</font>
The monsters in this game hit very hard and can kill a hero in only a few hits. So keep out of their reach! And don't stand on zombie corpses; they can reanimate without warning and take you down.
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>U</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>se your <script>InfoLinkG('Nanites', 'readmerebornarmor.html');</script> ability!</font>
It doesn't offer much protection until leveled up, but your Nanites ability acts as a personal shield that will significantly increase your lifespan.
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>U</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>se all your skills.</font>
When you select a hero, read the descriptions for your abilities, think about what situations would benefit from them, and then use them in those situations. Each class has a well-defined and significant role that you should strive to fulfill.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>K</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>eep moving.</font>
The undead home in on your general location. If you stand in one spot too long, you'll have them coming in from all directions. You'll also want the items scattered across the map as well as the rewards for completing objectives. And remember not to linger inside buildings.. very dangerous.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>D</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>on't panic on bosses.</font>
You and your team need to work together to slay the fatally dangerous bosses. There are five primary encounters, each requiring a different strategy to defeat. Have a plan and execute your role.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>V</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>ote appropriately.</font>
Don't vote for Hard or Insane difficulty unless you've beaten Normal. Your teammates should be appropriately experienced if you expect to win. Each higher difficulty level is significantly more challenging than the previous so don't be discouraged if you lose when advancing.</td></tr>
