In order to win the game, players must survive against 40 waves of enemies and defeat the final boss, Nemesis.
The game ends in defeat if the last surviving main hero dies, even if other support units are
still alive. Victorious games award much more <script>InfoLink('rank','readmerebornrank.html');</script> and
<script>InfoLink('renown','readmerebornrenown.html');</script> experience
and unlock rank caps for heroes who hadn't yet beaten the played difficulty level.
Completing wave 25 results in a partial victory, unlocking some ranks and giving full rank/renown experience.
Completing mini-quests is not necessary to win, but the rewards for doing so may make victory easier to achieve.
<br><br>
Ranks 4-6 are unlocked when a hero survives past the first 25 waves.
Ranks 7-9 are unlocked when a hero survives all 40 waves and defeats Nemesis.
Ranks 10+ can not be unlocked in Defense.
