When the game ends, your performance can increase your officer's Rank and Renown experience.
<br>
<img src="pics/ranks_dashes.gif" height=75/>
<br>
The dashes next to attribute icons represent the highest ranked Officer build
that had that attribute. When creating a new character, that character's initial rank will be set to the minimum unlocked
rank for all the attributes selected.
<br>
For example, if you made a Rank 4 Skilled Medic and a Rank 3
Gifted Tactician (and all other attributes being equal), you could make a Rank 3 Gifted Medic because you
already unlocked Medic to Rank 4 and Gifted to Rank 3
<br><br>
Certain ranks are restricted until you have completed a specific difficulty on Hive/City or defeated a specific wave number on defense.
Once you have completed that difficulty, the unlocked ranks are available for every hero, not just the one
that completed the difficulty. It is not possible to go beyond rank 9 through Defense alone.
<br>
Winning a difficulty with Challenges enabled will allow that build to potentially unlock one rank
higher than the cap for that difficulty. This does not unlock the rank for all builds.
<br>
For example, winning Normal mode with challenges would allow that build to get to Captain (rank 7), if it earned enough rank in that game, even if
that rank has not been unlocked yet because the player has not beaten Hard mode. But other builds would still be capped at rank 6 unless challenge mode was won again.
<br>
Winning challenge mode on Insane is required to get a rank 11 build and unlock the ability to vote for Nightmare.
Once a player wins Nightmare, ranks 1-11 are unlocked for all builds.

Heroes must achieve the rank of National Hero before they can participate in a Nightmare game
which is where the real challenge begins. Only Legendary Heroes can attempt Extinction, the
experts' difficulty level.</font>
<br><br>
The following table lists the hero bonuses associated with each rank. Each class has a unique
bonus which improves with rank.
The max level of the <script>InfoLink('Assault Droid','unitinfo-lad.htm')</script> is determined
by the combined ranks of all heroes in the game.
