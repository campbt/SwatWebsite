When the game ends, your performance can increase your officer's Rank and Renown experience.
<br><br>
When creating a new character, that character's initial rank will be set to the minimum unlocked
rank for all the attributes selected.
<br>
For example, if you made a Rank 4 Skilled Medic and a Rank 3
Gifted Tactician (and all other attributes being equal), you could make a Rank 3 Gifted Medic because you
already unlocked Medic to Rank 4 and Gifted to Rank 3
<br><br>
Certain ranks are restricted until you have completed a specific difficulty. Once you have
completed that difficulty, the unlocked ranks are available for every hero, not just the one
that completed the difficulty.
<br><br><font color=ffe888>
Heroes must achieve the rank of National Hero before they can participate in a Nightmare game
which is where the real challenge begins. Only Legendary Heroes can attempt Extinction, the
experts' difficulty level.</font>
<br><br>
The following table lists the hero bonuses associated with each rank. Each class has a unique
bonus which improves with rank.
The max level of the <script>InfoLink('Assault Droid','unitinfo-lad.htm')</script> is determined
by the combined ranks of all heroes in the game.
