When the game ends, your performance can increase your officer's Rank and Renown experience.
<br><br>
Renown is not attached to any specific build you make, but rather rather your Steam account.
It has a cap at level 55 and levels up slower than Rank (especially for levels 51-55).
Certain renown levels unlock perks that become available on all builds immediately.
Renown level is also used to calculate your votekick weight and strength of the -revive command.
<br><br>
The following table lists all the unlocks.
