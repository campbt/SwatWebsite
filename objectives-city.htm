The game begins with each player voting for one of three core difficulty levels: Normal, Hard, or Insane.
If a player has at least one rank 11 build, they may vote for the challenge mode, Nightmare.
If all players have unlocked at least one rank 12 build, they may vote for Extinction.
Difficulty level scales numerous aspects of the game and determines the requirements of the primary objectives.
<br><br>
In order to win the game, players must successfully complete the primary objectives (in any order) and then defeat a final boss, Nemesis, with at least one
player's main hero alive. The game ends in defeat if the last surviving main hero dies, even if other support units are
still alive. Victorious games award much more <script>InfoLink('rank','readmerebornrank.html');</script> and
<script>InfoLink('renown','readmerebornrenown.html');</script> experience
and unlock rank caps for heroes who hadn't yet beaten the played difficulty level. Completing mini-quests
is not necessary to win, but the rewards for doing so may make victory easier to achieve.
<br><br>
Rank 11 is unlocked when a hero has beaten Insane with Challenges enabled.
Once Nightmare has been beaten, the player unlocks Rank 11 for all builds without having to win Insane with Challenges again.
Rank 12 requires winning Nightmare with each build.
<br><br>
The hardest difficulty level, Extinction, requires all players to load a Rank 12 build and there must be at least two players.
Beating it requires winning with all three primary objectives over-achieved and the
Hazmat and Red Rads mini-quests completed.
<br><br>
<font size=-1><i>Survival can be selected instead of voting for a core difficulty level. This bonus mode
is included for players who simply want to kill stuff. Heroes can earn rank/renown experience in Survival but cannot
unlock rank caps. There are no primary objectives in this mode except to stay alive until dawn of Day 3 (44 minutes).</i></font>
