Cooperative map against waves of computer-controlled enemies. Teamwork is essential as is using each class's
strengths to their fullest. Enemies are numerous and extremely dangerous, resulting in non-stop and intense action.

<li>Five difficulty levels scale every aspect of the game, providing a fun challenge to new players and pros alike; each level is significantly harder than the previous, and higher levels add new content that requires you to expand your strategies
<li>Difficulty adjusts based on the number of players so soloers and teams of any size can enjoy the game equally
<li>Extensive randomization ensures a new experience every time, enabling you to replay and enjoy the game hundreds of times
<li>Multiple <script>InfoLink('maps', 'readmerebornobjectives.html');</script> to play on, each with unique challenges and objectives to complete.
<li>Multiple interactive and diverse victory <script>InfoLink('objectives', 'readmerebornobjectives.html');</script> encourage aggressive, explorative play; camping will not lead to victory
<li>Customize your hero by selecting from one of twelve distinct and balanced <script>InfoLink('classes','readmerebornclasses.html');</script> and then picking your <script>InfoLink('weapon','readmerebornweapons.html');</script>, <script>InfoLink('armor','readmerebornarmor.html');</script>, <script>InfoLink('trait','readmereborntraits.html');</script>, <script>InfoLink('specialization','readmerebornspecs.html');</script>, and <script>InfoLink('talent','readmereborntalents.html');</script>; there are thousands of unique combinations, each with multiple ability builds
<li>Advance your hero with <script>InfoLink('rank','readmerebornrank.html');</script> and <script>InfoLink('renown','readmerebornrenown.html');</script> across multiple sessions; rank/renown brings prestige and combat bonuses but never outweighs player skill
<li>Intricately-designed hero, skill, item, and monster systems, all based on sci-fi technology
<li>Very challenging, hero-focused gameplay requires teamwork, micromanagement, and strategy
<li>Voting system allows players to kick teamkillers and laggers
<li>Supported Languages: English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Russian

<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>S</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>tay together.</font>
Any hero can kill incoming zombies, but if you're alone when a large pack comes at you, you're in trouble. Staying with the team allows everyone's skills to benefit each other and provides a wall of fire to keep the undead at bay.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>K</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>eep away from enemies.</font>
The monsters in this game hit very hard and can kill a hero in only a few hits. So keep out of their reach! And don't stand on zombie corpses; they can reanimate without warning and take you down.
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>U</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>se your <script>InfoLinkG('Nanites', 'readmerebornarmor.html');</script> ability!</font>
It doesn't offer much protection until leveled up, but your Nanites ability acts as a personal shield that will significantly increase your lifespan.
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>U</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>se all your skills.</font>
When you select a hero, read the descriptions for your abilities, think about what situations would benefit from them, and then use them in those situations. Each class has a well-defined and significant role that you should strive to fulfill.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>K</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>eep moving.</font>
The undead home in on your general location. If you stand in one spot too long, you'll have them coming in from all directions. You'll also want the items scattered across the map as well as the rewards for completing objectives. And remember not to linger inside buildings.. very dangerous.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>D</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>on't panic on bosses.</font>
You and your team need to work together to slay the fatally dangerous bosses. There are five primary encounters, each requiring a different strategy to defeat. Have a plan and execute your role.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>V</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>ote appropriately.</font>
Don't vote for Hard or Insane difficulty unless you've beaten Normal. Your teammates should be appropriately experienced if you expect to win. Each higher difficulty level is significantly more challenging than the previous so don't be discouraged if you lose when advancing.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td align=right><font color=ffe888>R</font></td><td align=left><font color=ffe888>ead reference info.</font>
